# Howdy Next

Howdy provides Windows Hello™ style authentication for Linux. Use your built-in
IR emitters and camera in combination with facial recognition to prove who you
are.

Using the central authentication system (PAM), this works everywhere you would
otherwise need your password: Login, lock screen, sudo, su, etc.

## Installation

Howdy is currently available and packaged for Debian/Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Fedora
and openSUSE. If you’re interested in packaging Howdy for your distro, don’t
hesitate to open an issue.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The build of dlib can hang on 100% for over a minute, give it time.

### Ubuntu or Linux Mint

Run the installer by pasting (`ctrl+shift+V`) the following commands into the
terminal one at a time:

```text
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:boltgolt/howdy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install howdy
```

This will guide you through the installation.

### Debian

Download the .deb file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/releases) and install with gdebi.

### Arch Linux

_Maintainer wanted._

Install the `howdy` package from the AUR. For AUR installation instructions,
take a look at this
[wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).

You will need to do some additional configuration steps. Please read the
[ArchWiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Howdy) for more
information.

### Fedora

_Maintainer: [@luyatshimbalanga](https://github.com/luyatshimbalanga)_

The `howdy` package is available as a
[Fedora COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/principis/howdy/),
install it by simply executing the following commands in a terminal:

```text
sudo dnf copr enable principis/howdy
sudo dnf --refresh install howdy
```

_Note:_ Fedora 41
[removed support for Python2](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/RetirePython2.7),
but at this point in time Howdy still depends on it. If the install fails, you
can fix this by installing the beta Repository and removing the release version:

```text
sudo dnf copr remove principis/howdy
sudo dnf copr enable principis/howdy-beta
sudo dnf --refresh install howdy
```

See the link to the COPR repository for detailed configuration steps.

### openSUSE

_Maintainer: [@dmafanasyev](https://github.com/dmafanasyev)_

Go to the [openSUSE wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Facial_authentication) for detailed installation instructions.

### Building from Source

If you want to build Howdy from source, a few dependencies are required.

#### Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
  - pip
  - setuptools
  - wheel
- meson version 0.64 or higher
- ninja
- INIReader (can be pulled from git automatically if not found)
- libevdev

To install them on Debian/Ubuntu for example:

```text
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel \
cmake make build-essential \
libpam0g-dev libinih-dev libevdev-dev python3-opencv \
python3-dev libopencv-dev
```

#### Build

```sh
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
```

You can also install Howdy to your system with `meson install -C build`.

## Setup

After installation. Run `sudo howdy add` to add a face model.

If nothing went wrong we should be able to run sudo by just showing your face.
Open a new terminal and run `sudo -i` to see it in action. Please check
[this wiki page](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/wiki/Common-issues) if you're
experiencing problems or [search](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/issues) for
similar issues.

If you're curious you can run `sudo howdy config` to open the central config
file and see the options Howdy has to offer. On most systems this will open the
nano editor, where you have to press `ctrl`+`x` to save your changes.

## CLI

The installer adds a `howdy` command to manage face models for the current user.
Use `howdy --help` or `man howdy` to list the available options.

Usage:

```text
howdy [-U user] [-y] command [argument]
```

| Command    | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `add`      | Add a new face model for a user             |
| `clear`    | Remove all face models for a user           |
| `config`   | Open the config file in your default editor |
| `disable`  | Disable or enable howdy                     |
| `list`     | List all saved face models for a user       |
| `remove`   | Remove a specific model for a user          |
| `snapshot` | Take a snapshot of your camera input        |
| `test`     | Test the camera and recognition methods     |
| `version`  | Print the current version number            |

### Troubleshooting

Any Python errors get logged directly into the console and should indicate what
went wrong. If authentication still fails but no errors are printed, you could
take a look at the last lines in `/var/log/auth.log` to see if anything has been
reported there.

Please first check the
[wiki on common issues](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/wiki/Common-issues)
and if you encounter an error that hasn't been reported yet, don't be afraid to
open a new issue.

#### A Note on Security

This package is in no way as secure as a password and will never be. Although
it's harder to fool than normal face recognition, a person who looks similar to
you, or a well-printed photo of you could be enough to do it. Howdy is a more
quick and convenient way of logging in, not a more secure one.

To minimize the chance of this program being compromised, it's recommended to
leave Howdy in `/lib/security` and to keep it read-only.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> DO NOT USE HOWDY AS THE SOLE AUTHENTICATION METHOD FOR YOUR SYSTEM.
